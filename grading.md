# Grading Policy
This course uses the grading policy known as specifications grading. It has been demonstrated to provide much greater equity in the classroom and as a result improves achivement of learning objectives. However this system may be new to you. It does take some time to understand and we are ready to help you with any questions you may have. Please take advantage of office hours. For additional reading on this policy please start here [(link)](https://cte.virginia.edu/blog/2020/12/04/alternative-grading-practices-support-both-equity-and-learning).

## Approach
This course does not have exams or the concept of "points". Instead there are bundles of assignments, that when completed that earn letter grades. Every individual assignment is marked as "meets spec" or "does not meet spec yet". In order to understand what "meets spec" every assignment is accompianed by a single-level rubric that outlines three things:
1. The purpose (Why am I doing this?)
2. The task (What am I going to do?)
3. The criteria (A detailed description of the necessary components of a "meets spec" submission)

The goal is to make the assignments as transparent as possible and not withold information from the students. For example in a traditional exam the students are told a list of subjects that may be on the test. The uncertainty causes anxiety and wastes an emmense ammount of time. Instead of giving exams this class provides clear instruction on tasks to perform which yield the same result (mastery of learning objectives) without the anxiety and timewasting of studying for the unknown.

## Assignment Types (duplicated in top level syllabus)
Each assignment has a rubric to indicate the purpose, task, and criteria for the assignment. They are grouped into several categories summarized below. Details of how the assignments map onto course letter grades is presented in [Grading Policy Summary](grading.md). Alignment to the learning objectives is shown in the individual rubrics. 

The 5 assignment categories:
1. Project Milestones - These assignments describe milestones in the project cycle and help guide the student through the process of working a project from start to finish.
2. Critiques - These assignments are about providing critique to others and to yourself.
3. Documentation - These assignments serve two purposes. The first is to practice communicating the technical details of your work by documenting your code. The second is to highlight the contributions you made to each project cycle.
4. Case Studies - These assignments are about studying how to present your projects in a way in which someone else could pick it up and study it.

## Bundles
The following table summarizes the assignmenmts required to "meet spec" to earn certain letter grades.

|Assignment |C|B|A|
|--|--|--|--|
|(MI 1) Create Hypothesis and Model Plan|3|3|3|
|(MI 2) Establish Data Set and Create Project Plan|3|3|3|
|(MI 3) Create Pipeline and Perform Analysis|3|3|3|
|(MI 4) Prepare Results for presentation|3|3|3|
|(PR 1) Present Results (oral)|1|1|1|
|(CC 1) Constructive Critique of Others||3|3|
|(CC 2) Constructive Critique of Self||3|3|
|(ID 1) Individual Documentation||3|3|
|(CS 1) Case-study: review & reflection|||2|
|(CS 2) Case-study: produce (manuscript)|||1|

There is an alternative to completing the 3 case study assignments for the A bundle. You may participate in a data project challenge. Doing so will count for all CS 1 and CS 2 assignments. The two challenges for this term are:

1. LMI [Data Entrepreneurship Challenge](https://www.lmi.org/challenge) - register by 9/29 (a Friday)
2. Purdue School of Business [Data 4 Good](https://purdue.university/3rHKMpP) - register by 9/17 (a Friday)

Your team from DS 4002 may do a competition together but you do not have to. An individual student may enter the competition with others, including students not in DS 4002, and it will still count.
