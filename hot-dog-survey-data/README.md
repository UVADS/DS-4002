# Hot Dog Survey Data

## Tasks: 
This survey investigates whether UVA students beleive that a hot dog can or cannot be categorized as a sandwich, and why. It asks for students background information, including thier year, scholarly status, field of study, and state/country of origin.


## Notes:
There has been strong discorse across social media in concerning the question of whether a hot dog is a sandwich. To answer this question at a small-scale level, a google-form based survey was conducted at the University of Virginia, distributed via students enrolled in DS 4002. The survey questions were designed not only to obtain students' opinions on the hot dog/sandwich issue, but thier demographics relating to the University, in hopes to uncover what kinds of students are on either side of the issue. In future analysis, it will be necessary to examine the relationship between home location and hot-dog opinion; graduate vs. undergraduate and hot dog opinion; major and hot dog opinion; academic year and hot dog opinion; and rationale and hot dog opinion.
