8/28/2023 13:23:38,,8/28/2023,Yes,No,"Sandwich (noun): an item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal.

Hotdog (noun): hot dog; plural noun: hot dogs; noun: hotdog; plural noun: hotdogs
1. a frankfurter, especially one served hot in a long, soft roll and topped with various condiments.
""he's ordering a hot dog""

These definitions were retrieved from the Oxford language dictionary. A hot dog, as described, is a ‘frankfurter served hot in a long roll’. This roll typically is one cut piece of bread, but can also be two independent pieces, which would make a hotdog more sandwich-like. Additionally, it is important to note the distinction between the phrases ‘served in’ and ‘two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them’. The specificity of a hot dog could technically fit into the vague description of a sandwich. However, I would argue that a hot dog’s unique specificity allows it to be regarded as its own entity. A hot dog is ‘served in’ a sliced roll, whereas a sandwich is ‘two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them’. Yes, a hot dog could be served between two pieces of bread, however it is often one sliced roll and, therefore, should be regarded as something independent from a sandwich. Additionally, one who eats a hot dog between two pieces of sliced bread is usually thought of as ‘weird’. Popular opinion often supports this belief (no source). Therefore, a hot dog is not, never has been, and never should be referred to as a sandwich, unless special circumstance requires a hot dog to be listed under the ‘between the buns’ part of a menu. The vagueness of ‘between the buns’ allows for the preservation of a hot dog’s unique specificity.",,Yfp4yf@virginia.edu,Yes

8/28/2023 23:28:40,,8/28/2023,Yes,No,"A hot dog is ostensibly a taco. The baked apparatus (whether it be made of wheat, rye, or corn [in the case of a taco]) is folded around three sides of the interior material. Any who break the lower region of the bun may argue that two sides are covered, and therefore the hot dog is a sand which. But they are objectively wrong to do so because the required and honest method of eating said delicacy involves resting the dog within a three sided pocket of bread. Either a hot dog is a taco or a taco is a hot dog. I will entertain no further discussion.",,yag2jz@virginia.edu,Yes
8/29/2023 1:22:20,,8/29/2023,Yes,No,"A sandwich is defined as meat in between bread like substance, correct? Yes but not 100% the true. Not all meat in between bread is considered a sandwich. The reason is of the way the bread surrounds the hot dog. If we view the world in an xyz coordinate plane with x being left to right, y bring forward and backward, and z being up and down, you’ll see that in a sand which the bread and meat exist in the xy plane, and lay flat on top of each other. However with a hotdog, the traditional way of forming a hotdog has the format in the yz plane. Another important aspect to look into is the intersection between planes. A sand which will have its layers confined, and the bread will never be fully on the same point in the z axis with the meat. Here are some of my examples to back up: 

Do u call a burrito a sandwich (meat between bread like substance right??) hell fucking no u don’t, and look how the bread and meat exist together in the z axis, something that should not happen. ",,tbw3hs@virginia.edu,Yes
