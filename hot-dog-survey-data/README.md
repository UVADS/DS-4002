# Hot Dog Survey Data
This survey was conducted in order to answer the question of whether or not undergraduate students at the University of Virginia thought a hot dog was a sandwich. The survery was conducted over roughly a five day period and was sent out by members of the DS4002 class. Within the survey, multiple questions were asked including whether the person responding was an undergraduate student and whether or not they thought that a hot dog was a sandwich.
