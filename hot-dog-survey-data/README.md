# Hot Dog Survey Data

This project is designed to investigate how UVA students view hot dogs; as a sandwich or not. We collected data from students by having them filling out a survey. The raw data are uploaded in the file hot_do_survey_responses.xlsx, and the data dictionary describing the data is in the file data_dictionary_sp24. 

Seeks to answer the age old debate of if a hotdog is a sandwhich.

I have edited the README to verify the workflow is working.
