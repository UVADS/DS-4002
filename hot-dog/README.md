# Spring 2023 Hot Dog Data

## Hypothesis
1/3 of UVA undergraduate students will answer yes to the question, "Is a hot dog a sandwich?"

## Data Collection Process
Our data collection process had 3 main steps. First, we created a Google Forms Survey with four questions asking if Taylor Swift is the GOAT, if you like hotdogs, if a hotdog is a sandwich, and for a hot take. Next, each member of the class sent out the survey to UVA undergraduate students for responses to be collected. The ultimate goal was to collect as many responses as possible over the course of five days. Finall, the data was compiled into a CSV file for further analysis.
