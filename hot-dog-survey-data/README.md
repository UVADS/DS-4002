# Hot Dog Survey Data

Tasks: 

- In this README file, briefly describe the project. 
- Create a separate markdown file as a data dictionary. Look at examples from last terms.

This project will analyze the sentiment over the generational debate of "is a hot dog a sandwich?" A survey was taken of undergraduate students at the University of Virginia asking them for their response to the question and other information about them.
