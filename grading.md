# Grading Policy
This course uses the grading policy known as specifications grading. It has been demonstrated to provide much greater equity in the classroom and as a result improves achivement of learning objectives. However this system may be new to you. It does take some time to understand and we are ready to help you with any questions you may have. Please take advantage of office hours. For additional reading on this policy please start here [(link)](https://cte.virginia.edu/blog/2020/12/04/alternative-grading-practices-support-both-equity-and-learning).

## Approach
This course does not have exams or the concept of "points". Instead there are bundles of assignments, that when completed that earn letter grades. Every individual assignment is marked as "meets spec" or "does not meet spec yet". In order to understand what "meets spec" every assignment is accompianed by a single-level rubric that outlines three things:
1. The purpose (Why am I doing this?)
2. The task (What am I going to do?)
3. The criteria (A detailed description of the necessary components of a "meets spec" submission)

The goal is to make the assignments as transparent as possible and not withold information from the students. For example in a traditional exam the students are told a list of subjects that may be on the test. The uncertainty causes anxiety and wastes an emmense ammount of time. Instead of giving exams this class provides clear instruction on tasks to perform which yield the same result (mastery of learning objectives) without the anxiety and timewasting of studying for the unknown.

## Assignment Types (duplicated in top level syllabus)
Each assignment has a rubric to indicate the purpose, task, and criteria for the assignment. They are grouped into several categories summarized below. Details of how the assignments map onto course letter grades is presented in [Grading Policy Summary](grading.md). Alignment to the learning objectives is shown in the individual rubrics. 

The 5 assignment categories:
1. Project Milestones - These assignments describe milestones in the project cycle and help guide the student through the process of working a project from start to finish.
3. Critiques - These assignments are about providing critique to others and to yourself.
4. Case Studies - These assignments are about studying how to present your projects in a way in which someone else could pick it up and study it.
5. Reflection - These assignments provide space for further reflection and investigation on items that you find interesting but do not necessarially have time to work on during your project.

## Bundles
The following table summarizes the assignmenmts required to "meet spec" to earn certain letter grades.

|Code|Assignment Type|#|C|B|A|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|LABS|Labs|13|12|12|12|
|READ|"Read" & Review|14|--|12|12|
|CASE|Case Study Extension|4|--|1|2|
|LOOK|Look Ahead|4|--|1|2|
|ESSY|Final Essay Parts|3|1|2|3|

## Flexibility Provisions
1. Labs: There is a make up lab week at the end of the term where students can complete a lab they were unable to complete.
2. Non-labs: For each of the non-lab assignments there are 2 more assignments given than are required for the A bundle. No assignment is essential.
3. Resubmission: After visiting office hours to discuss an assignment that "did not meet spec yet" resubmission may be allowed.
4. Final Essay: The intention is for the students to bring ideas to the professors for help developing and that comments will be given on the essay if submitted more than one week prior to the due date.
