### Provenance ###
This data came from a google form survey that was conducted in the Fall Semester of 2025 for the DS4002 course.
The form data was collected at around 12:20 on 9/1/2025 so all collected data past this timestamp is not included in our sample.
The data was then inputted into the Fa25 folder in DS4002 as an xlsx file and manipulated from there.

### Data Dictionary ###
The Timestamp column gives us a timestamp unique to each form response. This identifies the data as a time series dataset.
The "What Year Are You In?" question was a multiple choice question that allowed integer inputs only (1-4).
The "Is Hotdog A Sandwich?" question was a multiple choice question that allowed two text inputs "Yes" or "No".
