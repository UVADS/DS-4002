also, if we tore the bun at its seams then if the hotdog is not a sandwich because the flaps are connected then what do we call a hotdog with buns divorced like a cheating husband because surely now it is a sandwich but ontologically it is still a hotdog, yet if a hot dog is not a sandwich then we can not call this alteration a hotdog. therefore logically the hotdog Must be a sandwich so we do not form this puzzling paradox",Yes,biology,United States,,Prefer not to answer,

1/15/2025 22:47:26,Yes,"A sandwich is an item of food with fillings placed betwixt bread slices or in a sliced roll. For example, despite a sub sandwich not being two distinct pieces of bread, there is no doubt that it is a sandwich. Likewise, an open-faced turkey sandwich (typically turkey and gravy, occasionally with mashed potatoes, on top of a slice of bread), despite its name, is not a sandwich, due to it being placed atop the bread, and not betwixt. The filling debate is also a non-starter. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are undoubtedly sandwiches despite a lack of meat and cheese. Therefore, there is no comparable example of a sandwich, or non-sandwich that would disqualify the hot dog from being considered a sandwich. The better question is, is a gyro a sandwich? What about a taco? What determines if the bread counts as bread? Does the bread require leavening to make it a sandwich or is a flour tortilla sufficient? These are the real questions that we can use to determine the true reaches of the sandwich definition. As for who knows this, maybe only God himself.",Yes,Commerce,Virginia,Fourth year,Man,
